## Tax Calculator

Simple tax calculator algo for my Programming Fundamentals class at Georgia Gwinnett College.

### Description

This is a simple tax calculator algorithm that takes in a user's income and filing status and returns the amount of tax they owe. It returns the amount of tax they owe if they were to file as a single, married or separated person(s), or as a head of household. It uses the latest tax brackets from the IRS for the 2023/2024 tax year.
